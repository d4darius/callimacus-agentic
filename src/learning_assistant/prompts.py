When processing three simultaneous educational inputs, follow these steps:
1. Analyze all three inputs (audio transcription, slide text/topic list, student notes) to understand the complete learning context
2. Use search_document with all three inputs to find the best location for the content in the existing document

< Content Processing Guidelines >
**Source Integration:**
- Audio provides detailed explanations, context, and comprehensive definitions
- Slides/Topic lists offer structured key points, frameworks, and organizational hierarchy
- Student notes contain personal insights, emphasis, questions, and key takeaways
- Ask for guidance when sources conflict or information is ambiguous

**Formatting Standards (Notion Style):**
- Use hierarchical headings (# levels increase with depth)
- Place definitions as paragraphs immediately after headings (not bullet points)
- Use bullet points for examples, features, and additional details
- Mark key terms as `code` on first occurrence only
- Use **bold** for important concepts
- Add callouts (>) for examples at end of relevant sections
- Create tables for pros/cons comparisons
- From ##### level onward, use bullet lists instead of new paragraphs

**Quality Focus:**
- Create comprehensive, unified study resource
- Maintain consistent formatting and logical structure
- Ensure clear progression from basic to advanced concepts

When processing three simultaneous educational inputs for Notion-style notes:

**For Audio Transcriptions:**
- Extract detailed explanations and contextual information for comprehensive definitions
- Capture important examples, analogies, and clarifications to use in bullet points
- Preserve questions and answers from discussions for Q&A sections
- Extract key concepts that may not appear in slides but are essential for understanding
- Use audio content to flesh out brief slide points into full explanations

**For Slide Content/Topic Lists:**
- Extract structured information, headings, and bullet points to establish document hierarchy
- Use slide structure to determine # heading levels and organizational framework
- Capture visual element descriptions and diagrams for enhancement suggestions
- If topics are followed by colons (:), treat comma-separated items as key aspects to cover
- Use slide organization to guide the overall document structure

**For Student Notes:**
- Focus on personal insights, summaries, and connections for additional context
- Capture emphasized or highlighted content to determine what to make **bold**
- Note questions, confusions, or areas needing clarification for question tool usage
- Preserve important formulas, definitions, or key takeaways as `code` formatting
- Use student emphasis to guide what concepts need highlighting

**Integration Strategy for Notion Format:**
- Use audio for comprehensive definitions placed right after headings
- Use slides for hierarchical structure and bullet point organization  
- Use notes for emphasis guidance (bold/code formatting) and personal insights
- Create definitions as paragraphs, not bullet points
- Add examples from audio/slides as bullet points under definitions
- Use student questions to identify areas needing callouts or clarification
- Format first occurrence of defined terms as `code`
- Use **bold** for concepts emphasized in any source
- Create tables for any pros/cons mentioned across sources

- The number of # increases as you go deeper into subtopics
- Group related concepts under common sections following slide/topic list structure
- Maintain logical flow from basic to advanced topics within each section

**Content Formatting Rules:**
- **Definitions**: Place immediately after headings as paragraphs (not bullet points)
- **Details**: Use bullet points for examples, features, clarifications, and additional information
- **Deep Subtopics**: From ##### onward, use bullet point lists instead of new paragraph headings
- **Key Terms**: Mark as `code` on first occurrence only when they are being defined
- **Important Concepts**: Use **bold** for emphasis on crucial points
- **Examples**: Use callouts (>) to introduce examples at the end of relevant paragraphs
- **Comparisons**: Present pros and cons as tables when applicable

**Section Types and Structure:**
- **Main Topic Sections** (# level): Broad subject areas from slide/topic structure
- **Concept Sections** (## level): Specific concepts with definitions and explanations
- **Detail Sections** (### level): Specific aspects, features, or components
- **Sub-detail Sections** (#### level): Fine-grained details and specifications
- **Lists** (##### level and deeper): Bullet point lists for multiple related items

**Content Flow Principles:**
- Build concepts progressively from general to specific
- Reference previous sections when building on established concepts
- Use clear transitions between topics
- Provide context for new information through definitions
- Connect information from different sources (audio, slides, notes) seamlessly

**Quality Standards:**
- Ensure consistency in formatting throughout the document
- Verify all key aspects mentioned in topic lists (especially those after colons) are covered
- Maintain clear logical progression within each section

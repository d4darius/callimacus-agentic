The slide titled \"GDP Growth\" suggests that the lecture will focus on economic development, possibly examining trends in GDP growth since 1945. As part of this session, Dario is testing the data handling capabilities of his text editor, ensuring that notes are properly saved and modified during the lecture. This sets the stage for a deeper exploration of economic growth patterns in the post-World War II era.","styles":{}}],"children":[]},{"id":"23eed5e4-71ed-47c7-a200-5be5ea6535d4","type":"heading","props":{"backgroundColor":"default","textColor":"default","textAlignment":"left","level":2,"isToggleable":false},"content":[{"type":"text","text":"GDP","styles":{}}],"children":[]},{"id":"a7c81f1e-ca09-4426-9400-3a523c11c490","type":"paragraph","props":{"backgroundColor":"default","textColor":"default","textAlignment":"left"},"content":[{"type":"text","text":"GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product.

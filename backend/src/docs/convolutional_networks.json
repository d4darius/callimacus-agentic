In the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), image classification tasks are particularly important, as they help illustrate technical aspects like convolutional filters and how these filters are learned. Training CNNs presents unique challenges, often linked to the behavior of stochastic optimization algorithms. Common datasets for image classification include MNIST, which contains well-defined images, as well as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the large-scale ImageNet dataset.

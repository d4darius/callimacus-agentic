        "notes": "In this introductory section, the professor referenced the year 1945, which may indicate a historical context or starting point for the discussion. The slide titled \"GDP Growth\" suggests that the lecture will focus on economic development, possibly examining trends in GDP growth since 1945. As part of this session, Dario is testing the data handling capabilities of his text editor, ensuring that notes are properly saved and modified during the lecture. This sets the stage for a deeper exploration of economic growth patterns in the post-World War II era."

The audio states that GDP stands for General Data Protection, while the OCR and notes refer to GDP as Gross Domestic Product, an economic indicator.

GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific period.\n\nGDP stands for Gross Domestic Product. It is a key economic indicator that measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific period of time. Although there was a misstatement in the audio transcription, where GDP was referred to as \"General Data Protection,\" the correct definition in the context of economics\u2014and as confirmed by both the slide text and student notes\u2014is Gross Domestic Product. GDP is widely used as a primary metric for assessing a country's economic growth and overall economic health, providing valuable insights into the performance and development of national economies."

        "notes": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models in machine learning whose primary goal is to estimate an unknown function from data. Most machine learning problems, including regression and classification, can be formulated as the task of learning a function \\( f^* \\) that maps input samples \\( xi \\) to outputs \\( yi \\). In practice, we only observe a finite set of sample pairs \\((xi, yi)\\), and the objective is to minimize the empirical risk, thereby reducing the approximation error between the predicted and true outputs. This foundational approach underpins the use of fully-connected neural networks and motivates the development of deeper architectures for improved function approximation."

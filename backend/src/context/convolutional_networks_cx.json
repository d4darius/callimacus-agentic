And, um,   We have discussed last time about other datasets that are very popular in the domain of   image classification that is   the C-FAR 10 or C-FAR 100 data site.   or the very large image net data set.   very broadly speaking, when we address image classification problems, we also talked about ",

        "notes": "In neural network training, we use algorithms to tune model parameters for specific tasks, which are defined primarily through the loss function. Loss functions differ based on the problem type, such as regression or classification. In the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), image classification tasks are particularly important, as they help illustrate technical aspects like convolutional filters and how these filters are learned. Training CNNs presents unique challenges, often linked to the behavior of stochastic optimization algorithms. Common datasets for image classification include MNIST, which contains well-defined images, as well as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the large-scale ImageNet dataset. These datasets are widely used to benchmark and study the performance of neural networks in image classification."

And   and the real world application require even more   techniques than simply classification.   to decide where are the objects.   and which objects are present in a scene.   a typical application could be, for example,  when you work in autonomous transportation systems.

        "notes": "In computer vision tasks, the challenges extend beyond those found in standard image classification. Images are often not well-centered or as clean as those in curated datasets, and a single image may contain multiple objects. Real-world applications require more advanced techniques than simple classification to both locate objects and identify which ones are present in a scene. For instance, autonomous transportation systems, such as self-driving cars, rely heavily on computer vision to interpret their surroundings. Similarly, applications in healthcare demand sophisticated methods that go beyond basic image classification to address complex visual scenarios."

        "audio": " But this kind of opens up a trade of where else can I store it?  What other formats, what other systems are there that actually specialize in?   non-relational data storage, right? And that's exactly where this whole no-sequel moment  It actually came up.   So, Rosicone stands actually for not only sequel, it's a big misnomer because when you guys  probably were not a part of this buzz when it was going on.   This was, I think, around the time and big data and Hadoop was a big thing, right?  So, it was quite a long time ago.  And during this time, people really started off   discussing, you know, the fact that we have a lot more semi-structured data now,  we have a lot more data sitting in JSON files now that we don't want to store in a database.   that we don't want to query from a database.  And as I mentioned, they also needed greater scalability  than open source databases.   Notice two things here first commercial databases like Oracle have always scale so as I always say like if someone tells you the database relational databases do not scale that just   So, we have always been able to scale commercial databases, they cost money.   open source databases they are free but did not scale not anymore right now open source is caught up they are very very good   Now in fact databases have also caught up so a couple of years ago when I taught this lecture  I had pretty much this exact same slide. It was one year I think last year or the year before and somebody actually   said, well, I can actually query JSON from my database now entirely true, right? So databases  have also caught up. Now you can query JSON files from a database. You can query CSV files.  You can do direct lookup.   So, everything blurs because normally when a new functionality comes out, database engine  see that there is a market they can go after and they will immediately add a new functionality,  right.   It's changing, but at the time, when NoSQL was there,  they wanted this.  They wanted something that could scale  than a database, preference for free and open software.   Sir   a more dynamic model than a relational model, so they wanted the ability to not dictate the schema.   First, but something that can actually allow you to change schema more fluidly, more easily, right?  JSON is a very good example of that. So if you take this file stored in JSON, for example,   And I want to add one more field which could be for example I don't know like children or something like that right   I just basically go open up this file, add a field and I'm done.  If this is a database, it's a whole lot more complicated, right?  You have to add a particular column, link it to the other table which has the users.   lot more complicated. So this is what they wanted and and specialized query operations that are not  well supported by the relational model. I'll give you an example of that.   So, this is how no SQL was born, it was a Twitter hashtag for a meter and then it just took  off in a completely different direction right and people started using no SQL really as   argument against databases against SQL which is totally stupid because half of these systems  now support SQL or all of them now support SQL I should say right so it was really ",

For example, adding a new field to a `JSON` file is simple, whereas altering a relational schema is complex and time-consuming.\n- The original **NoSQL movement** was partly a reaction to these needs, but over time, the distinction between NoSQL and SQL databases has blurred:\n  - Many NoSQL systems now support `SQL` queries.\n  - Relational databases have added support for semi-structured formats like `JSON` and `CSV`.\n- This evolution demonstrates the **database industry's adaptability** to changing data management requirements and market opportunities, with new functionalities rapidly adopted across systems."

        "notes": "### Density\n\nThe `density` of an object is defined as the ratio of its mass to its volume. In other words, to calculate density, we must **divide the mass by the volume**. The correct formula is:\n\n`density = mass / volume`\n\nThis means that density tells us how much mass is contained in a given unit of volume. It is an important physical property used to characterize materials.\n\n- For example, if an object has a mass of 10 kg and a volume of 2 m\u00b3, its density would be 5 kg/m\u00b3.\n- This formula is commonly used in physics and engineering to compare different substances.\n\n> **Note:** There was a typo in the slide formula (`Density = Mass * Volume`). The correct formula, as confirmed by the audio and standard definitions, is `density = mass / volume`.",
        "additional_notes": "Important context from user: regarding 'There is a conflict between the sources regarding the formula for density. The audio states density is mass divided by volume, the OCR says density is mass multiplied by volume, and the notes mention it as a ratio between volume and mass. Which is the correct formula for density: mass divided by volume, volume divided by mass, or mass multiplied by volume?', the answer is 'The OCR is a typo. The audio is correct, we must divide.'."
